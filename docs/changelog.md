	* A server name and an extension name are required when using extensions in **fsm.yml**.

		```yaml
      	# bot.yml
      	extensions:
		  my_rest_server:                 # this server will be referenced as
		    type: REST                    # "my_rest_server" in the fsm.yml file
		    url: http://localhost:8770

		  my_rpc_server:                  # this server will be referenced as
			type: RPC                     # "my_rpc_server" in the fsm.yml file
			host: localhost
			port: 8770
		```

		```yaml
		# fsm.yml
		transitions:
		  - from:
			  - initial
			into: another_state
			command: foo
			extension:                    # this transition will execute the
			  server: my_rest_server      # extension "foo_extension" from the
			  name: foo_extension         # "my_rest_server" extension server

		  - from:
			  - initial
			into: another_state
			command: bar
			extension:                    # this transition will execute the
			  server: my_rpc_server       # extension "bar_extension" from the 
			  name: bar_extension         # "my_bar_server" extension server
		```

	!!! note
		Extension names do not need to begin with **"ext_"** any more.

* The `message` field in **fsm.yml** functions can only contain a list of message objects:

	```yaml
		message:
		- text: "Single message."

		message:
		- text: "A list"
		- text: "of simple messages"

		message:
		- text: "An image will be attached"
		- text: "to this message"
			image: https://i.imgur.com/8MU0IUT.jpeg
	```

* Extension functions must return a list of [`query.Answer`](https://godoc.org/github.com/jaimeteb/chatto/query#Answer)s, either by creating the objects or by using the [`query.Answers`](https://godoc.org/github.com/jaimeteb/chatto/query#Answers) function.

	!!! warning
		Package and function names were changed since the last version. Please refer to the [extensions documentation section](https://chatto.jaimeteb.com/extensions) for the updated names.

* Use `runtime.Formatter` when `DEBUG=true`.

---
## v0.4.2

* Add new example [*Misc Bot*](https://github.com/jaimeteb/chatto/tree/master/examples/02_misc).

    ```yaml
    slot:
      name: answer_1
      mode: regex
      regex: "[0-9]+"
    ```

---
## v0.4.0

* Add image support

	Messages can be either simple strings, or objects formed by an *image* URL and/or *text*.
	
	Example on **fsm.yml**:

	```yaml
	message:
      - text: "Oh don't be sad :("
      	image: https://i.imgur.com/8MU0IUT.jpeg
      - "Did that help?"
	```

	Example on extensions:

	```go
	func greetFunc(req *ext.Request) (res *ext.Response) {
		return &ext.Response{
			FSM: req.FSM,
			Res: cmn.Message{
				Text:  "Hello Universe",
				Image: "https://i.imgur.com/pPdjh6x.jpg",
			},
		}
	}
	```

* Moved *Message* objects into separate **common** package
* Moved *Extensions* into separate **ext** package
* Added Slack channel

	Add the Slack Token in the **chn.yml** file or set the `SLACK_TOKEN` environment variable.

	```yaml
	slack:
  	  token: MY_SLACK_TOKEN
	```

	And set the Event Subscriptions request URL to `/endpoints/slack`

* Refactored channels to allow for easier integration

---
## v0.3.1

* Improve CLI appearance
* Expire FSM in Cache and Redis
    * Use [patrickmn/go-cache](https://github.com/patrickmn/go-cache)
* Support easier integration for REST extensions (see below)

An extension REST service must implement these routes:

- `GET /ext/get_all_funcs`

	This route should return an array with the names of the registered extensions.

	Example response:
	```json
	[
		"ext_val_ans_1",
		"ext_val_ans_2",
		"ext_score"
	]
	```

- `POST /ext/get_func`

	This route should return the resulting Finite State Machine object after the extension's execution, along with a message or messages.

	Example request body:

	```json
	{
		"fsm": {
			"state": 2,
			"slots": {
				"answer_1": "3"
			}
		},
		"req": "ext_val_ans_1",
		"txt": "3",
		"dom": {
			"state_table": {
				"any": -1,
				"initial": 0,
				"question_1": 1,
				"question_2": 2,
				"question_3": 3
			},
			"command_list": [
				"start",
				"end"
			],
			"default_messages": {
				"unknown": "Not sure I understood, try again please.",
				"unsure": "Not sure I understood, try again please.",
				"error": "I'm sorry, there was an error."
			}
		}
	}
	```

	Example response:
	```json
	{
		"fsm": {
			"state": 2,
			"slots": {
				"answer_1": "3"
			}
		},
		"res": "Select one of the options."
	}
	```
